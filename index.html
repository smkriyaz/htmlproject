   <p style="width: 100%;">The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/;[4] lit. 'Crown of the Palace', [taːdʒ ˈmɛːɦ(ə)l]),[5] is an ivory-white marble
mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal
emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah
Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for
another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated
at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about U.S. $1 billion). The
construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court
architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one
of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal
architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in
2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p>

    <h3>KONARK SUN TEMPLE</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Konarka_Temple.jpg/1024px-Konarka_Temple.jpg" width="450" height="320" alt="temple">
    <p style="width: 50%;">Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri
    on the coastline of Odisha, India.[1][2] The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty
    about 1250 CE.[3][4]
    
    Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high
    chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high,[1][5] much of the temple
    is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the
    mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography,
    and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of
    the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga architecture.[1][6]
    
    The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and still remains a source of controversy.[7] Theories
    range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim
    armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.[1][7] This temple was called the "Black Pagoda" in European sailor accounts
    as early as 1676 because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black.[6][8] Similarly, the Jagannath Temple
    in Puri was called the "White Pagoda". Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of
    Bengal.[9][10] The temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era
    archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984,[1][2] it remains a major pilgrimage site for
    Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February.</p>

    <h3>HAMPI</h3>
    <img src="./images/hampi.jpg" width="450" height="320" alt="hampi">
    <p style="width: 50%;">Hampi or Hampe, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in
    east-central Karnataka, India.[2]
    
    Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century.[3] Chronicles left by Persian and European
    travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra
    River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest
    medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and
    Portugal.[4][5] The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered,
    pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.[3][6][7]
    
    Located in Karnataka near the modern-era city of Hosapete, Hampi's ruins are spread over 4,100 hectares (16 sq mi) and
    it has been described by UNESCO as an "austere, grandiose site" of more than 1,600 surviving remains of the last great
    Hindu kingdom in South India that includes "forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines,
    pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and others"</p>

    <h3>CHARMINAR</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Charminar-Pride_of_Hyderabad.jpg/800px-Charminar-Pride_of_Hyderabad.jpg" width="450" height="320" alt="charminar">
  <p style="width: 60%;">The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') constructed in 1591, is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The
landmark has become known globally as a symbol of Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognised structures in India.
It has also been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long
history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 400 years. While both historically and
religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has
become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival
celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr.[4]

The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi river.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest lies
the richly ornamented granite Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the
official "List of Monuments" prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and
combination of the Urdu words chār and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the eponymous towers are ornate
minarets attached and supported by four grand arches</p>
